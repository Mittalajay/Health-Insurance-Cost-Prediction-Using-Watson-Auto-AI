# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-Using-Watson-Auto-AI

Rising health care costs are a major economic and public health issue worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, health care accounted for 7.9% of Europe’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 . In Switzerland, the health care sector contributes substantially to the national GDP, and has increased from 10.7 to 12.1% between 2010 and 2015 . Moreover, because health care utilisation costs may serve as a surrogate for an individual’s health status , understanding which factors contribute to increases in health expenditures may provide insight into risk factors and potential starting points for preventive measures. In this study, I aimed to predict changes in patients’ health care costs  and to identify factors contributing substantially to this prediction. I  approached the problem as a  regression task, predicting whether patient’s total costs would increase or decrease  based on their characteristics . To capture different patterns in the data, I performed extensive feature engineering and  finally, performed a detailed feature importance analysis   based on the random forest   regressor  model.
